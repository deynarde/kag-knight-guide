[["index.html", "Knight Guides Tender is the Knight Introduction", " Knight Guides Tender is the Knight by Bunnie and deynarde 12/08/2020 Introduction We have read many tutorials concerning knight gameplay, both on the THD Forums and Steam Community Hub, and most of them were either shallow or outdated. Considering we've got a lot of new players recently, we have decided to write a new player friendly guide for the knight class. We hope this guide will help people who are trying to get better at knight. We are going to cover everything including: improving your skill to various levels, how to play CTF, how to deal with high ping or bugs, every knight trick/move you can do in this game and much more. It may seem like a lot, but knight combat is very extensive and if you want to get better this guide will certainly help you. For a tutorial on playing as archer see: Archer Guide. For a tutorial on playing as builder see: Builder Guide. You can contact us on KAG Discord (bunnie#8553, deynarde#4491). Big thanks to Turtlebutt and the HOMEK clan, especially to Homek, Biurza, Voxez (_Mike_), Magmus, Zanzibar, Psiklaw, Junko-Enoshima. Thanks to Ehra for correcting language mistakes "],["knight-i-the-basics.html", "Chapter 1 Knight I: The Basics 1.1 The knight class 1.2 Mechanics 1.3 Items 1.4 Mobility 1.5 Learning", " Chapter 1 Knight I: The Basics 1.1 The knight class There are three classes in KAG: the archer, the builder and the knight. The knight is arguably the strongest class of the game. A good team in Capture The Flag (CTF) or Take The Halls (TTH) should be mostly composed of knights protecting the builders and archers. In Team Deathmatch (TDM) the knight is often the most played class. As a knight in CTF and TTH, your role is to help the team advance forward and capture the enemy flag or hall. This chapter is mostly the very basics, so if you've already played KAG for a bit you could pretty much skip to the 2nd chapter. 1.2 Mechanics As a knight, you can utilise your sword and shield to do the following things: 1.2.1 Jab The simplest attack - simply click the left mouse button. Does 1 heart of damage. For now you should keep in mind that if you jab a shield, you will get stunned for a short while. Try avoiding jabbing a shield because you can get counter jabbed during the stun, or in some cases even slashed. 1.2.2 Slash A charged attack, takes half a second to charge. A slash does 2 hearts of damage and stuns the enemy for a short time. If the enemy is shielding, you will break their shield, stunning them (but for an even shorter time) but the enemy will not get damaged. Being able to do a slash as fast as possible is important when playing a knight -- you should be able to do them as soon as the cursor charges fully. 1.2.3 Double slash A double slash takes 1.25 second to fully charge. Again, watch the cursor for timings. A double slash does 4 hearts of damage in total if unshielded. If the enemy is shielding, the first slash breaks the shield, then the second slash deals 2 hearts of damage. 1.2.4 Shield slide Holding W and pointing your shield down while moving horizontally will allow you to shield slide. 1.2.5 Shield bash Also known as a shield stun. If you quickly shield slide into someone or jump at them with your shield down, they can get stunned for a short time (and sometimes knocked back). 1.2.6 Shield glide You can use your shield as a parachute: 1.2.7 Stomping Not specifically a knight-only move, but you can stomp the enemy if you fall onto them with enough momentum. Most stomps are 1 heart stomps, but 2 heart stomps are possible with enough velocity too. You can't be stomped by archers or builders if you have your shield up. However, if the stomp is combined with a shieldbash (having your shield down while jumping at the enemy), knights are still able to stomp other shielding knights. In the below gif first I do two single heart stomps, and then one two-heart stomp. 1.2.8 Combining slashes, jabs, stomps, bashes You can do much more than just that, of course. For example, you can slash someone and then quickly jab them right after if the slash damaged the enemy. You’ll learn more about combos in the next chapter. For now, it’s important to know the theory on how knight combat works. The one thing you should remember is to mostly use slashes for now; the most common mistake a new player can do is to jab spam which is easily countered by shielding, and can quickly get you killed. Try out various strategies, don't rely on jabs only. 1.3 Items There are various knight-specific items that you can utilise, such as bombs or waterbombs. These can be bought at the knight workshop in CTF, trader shops in TDM or generated by factories in TTH. 1.3.1 Bombs Bombs cost 25 coins in CTF knight shop or 20 coins in a TDM trader shop. They are activated by pressing space bar after selecting the bomb from your class menu (hold down the F key). It takes 4 seconds for a bomb to 'cook' before it explodes. You can throw bombs at enemies to damage them (the damage taken depends on how close to the enemy the bomb explodes -- 3 hearts or 1,5 hearts). You can perform &quot;bomb jumps&quot; on bombs as well. Simply jump slightly and then shield the bomb before it explodes. If a bomb is thrown too early, it can be picked up and thrown back by other people. Don't throw bombs too early and try to catch bombs thrown by enemies. 1.3.2 Waterbombs Waterbombs cost 30 coins in CTF and 40 coins in TDM. Again, select them from your class menu (hold down F key). When thrown, they explode on impact (with the enemy or with terrain) and stun for a short duration, as well as knock back the enemy. If you successfully stun someone with a water bomb, you can follow up with an attack, such as a slash or a double slash. If shielded, water bombs stun for half of the original time. It works the same way with shielded water arrows. You can also put a sponge in your inventory (bought at TDM trader shop or CTF builder shop -- 15 coins) for an even shorter stun. The stun is even shorter if you have both a sponge and your shield up. The sponge gets destroyed after absorbing two water stuns. 1.3.3 Mines Mines can be bought for 60 coins in a knight shop and can be used by all classes. After taking the mine out of your inventory (F key) you can throw it somewhere. The mine deploys if it's not moved for 2 seconds. Deployed mines instantly kill enemies that touch them and can't be shielded, so you should watch out for enemy mines! This is especially important when playing CTF and pushing with your team in a closed space -- let the builders destroy the mines, don't walk into them -- if you walk into a mine and your teammates are also near, they will be killed as well. You can pick up enemy mines before they deploy as well -- simply press the C key when next to them. Mines also explode upon contact with a corpse of the enemy team. If the mine explodes near the person who bought it, they will also die. Their teammates however would not (in other words -- you can die to enemy mines and to your own mines activated by enemies, but not to your teammates' mines). Mines also explode when shot by an archer of the opposing team (e.g. blue mine getting shot by red archer) 1.3.4 Kegs Kegs (costs 120 coins in knight shop) are powerful and unshieldable explosive items with a 6 second fuse, activated by pressing the space key (only knights can activate them). Kegs instantly kill all players in range of the explosion -- both teammates and enemies. You should avoid fighting enemies while holding a keg (you can't put it in your inventory) because upon being hit by the enemy (even if shielding) or stunned with a waterbomb, the keg will often fall off from your back. The enemy may then steal it and use it to hurt your team. Moreover, you're also much slower when holding a keg. Generally, you should activate kegs when next to any enemy structures/defenses. As you can also see on the above gif, kegs explode on impact instantly with high enough velocity, for example if you throw them from a tall tower. Kegs will also light other nearby unlit kegs on explosion. The fuse will be shorter than usual (like 1 second instead of 6 seconds). The keg will also fall off from your back after being shot by an archer (the keg must be shot -- shielded arrows won't cause the keg to fall). If that happens, pick it back up as fast as possible. Enemy fire arrows will light the keg as well. 1.4 Mobility One of the most important things to learn when you're starting to play KAG is how to navigate the terrain properly. If you don't feel comfortable with your character and its movement, you will have trouble slashing your enemies from a distance or even avoiding enemy attacks. You have to be able to move around obstacles freely, consistently use wall jumps, use your slash to gain additional momentum or jump while slashing to quickly move through terrain. You can jump higher than normal if you slash while jumping. There's not that much to explain regarding basic movement -- it just takes practice. If you want to get better with movement faster, you can try experimenting with it in solo gamemodes (Save the Princess, Challenges modes etc.) You will learn more about mobility tricks during the next chapter. 1.5 Learning Every time you die to someone, ask yourself a question -- why did I die? Could I have done something to avoid death? Did I mess up timing or get baited by the enemy? Always try to learn from your mistakes. Look at what you're doing wrong (jabbing enemy's shield, bad slash timing and so on) and try to optimize your playstyle. Remember to slash often -- if you constantly slash, the enemies will be afraid to get closer to you. Make use of double slashes as well -- the first slash breaks the shield and the second one deals 2 hearts of damage, as mentioned earlier. Don't get demotivated if you're not as good as you want to be -- as we said earlier, at this level you just need to practice a lot. Skill will come with time. Most of the players get stuck at what this guide considers the average level. The next chapters should help you get past that point. "],["knight-ii-intermediate.html", "Chapter 2 Knight II: Intermediate 2.1 Knight model, slash and jab range 2.2 On learning itself 2.3 More on mobility 2.4 More on combat and using your sword 2.5 Shield bashing and countering it", " Chapter 2 Knight II: Intermediate 2.1 Knight model, slash and jab range We'll start this section with a word about hitboxes in KAG: The hitbox of a knight is a circle (it's an octagon here and that's false, but don't mind it). Both jab and slash are shaped as arcs, which move with your character and are active for a certain duration (slashes last much longer than jabs). Your shield covers an arc around your character centered on the direction pointed by your mouse. If you were hit through your shield by someone, you may have not been aiming at the right direction to cover the full arc of the attack. It is possible to see your hit boxes by going into solo sandbox mode, opening the console (by pressing HOME key) and typing /g_debug 1. 2.2 On learning itself If you want to get better at knight, the most important thing is practice. There are 3 options for that: playing TDMs, playing CTF or playing on a custom 1v1 server. 1v1s allow you to fully focus on purely knight gameplay, movement and timing. TDM is similar, but also with the inclusion of archers and items, so you get to train against them too. On CTF you're able to greatly help your builders and practice positioning and fighting against many enemies at once, as well as using kegs and bombs properly. You should always try to use tricks consistently. For a lot of moves, you just need to get into the habit of using them. If you really want to get better, we recommend always focusing and actually trying, no matter who you are playing against or what mode it is; playing optimally helps you in training muscle memory and getting used to the mechanics of knight combat. This applies to anyone, regardless of your skill level -- you should always give your best. Doing this will make you a better player. As mentioned in the first chapter, analysing your play style and mistakes also helps a lot. It may be hard to do so in real-time, so you may decide to record your gameplay and analyse the videos later. We suggest recording your 1v1 gameplay. In summary -- don't stop trying, always give your best, and try to use the moves and tricks you learned here in actual matches, don't be afraid to experiment with your playstyle. 2.3 More on mobility At this point, it would be good to learn basic mobility tricks, such as these -- they're useful in more situations than you may think, so you should be able to do them consistently. Good mobility is as important as good timings and reflexes. 2.3.1 Slash jumping A knight can jump higher than normal by slashing to get extra velocity. Time your slash so that it releases right after you start your jump. It can be combined with an upwards shield glide in order to get extra height. By pushing off the wall as you get near the top and then floating back onto it, you can also climb more -- in total up to 10 blocks (although this is mostly done for 7-9 block high walls). This can be useful when you're escaping from the enemies' base with their flag (but in that case, you're not going to be able to climb as much). You can also do the same with a double slash -- a total of 10 blocks can be climbed this way (in theory you can do 11, but it's not very practical). 2.3.2 Looking at proper direction while charging a slash Aiming in the same direction to which you are moving will allow you to move a little faster while charging an attack. You should always do this whenever you're charging a slash! It's also the same for when you're not slashing and just moving -- moving backwards is slower, so if you want to be quick, try to not do that. 2.3.3 Quick shield slide Shield sliding is performed by pointing the mouse below your character and shielding. However, you can move significantly faster by rapidly tapping the W key as you slide. For maximum speed, try to hit W as soon as you hit the ground on each bounce. Quick shield sliding is very useful when you're escaping from several enemies, or from an enemy charging a double slash. In the gif below I quickly shield slide a few times, and at the end I do a slow shield slide with just holding W for comparison (thumbs down emote). 2.3.4 Climbing arrows It is possible to climb arrows that have been shot into blocks. It is also possible to navigate around platforms on towers if there are enough arrows. Arrows that are stuck in air (for example, if they were shot at a structure that collapsed later) can also be climbed. 2.3.5 Using walls for extra velocity Pushing off a wall will give you a small burst of speed. This speed boost can be helpful to win battles by utilising slash timings. You can often surprise the enemy who won't expect you to walljump off a 2 block tall wall. Walljumps can also be used in order to gain height advantage over enemies, thus allowing you to slash them more easily. They can be utilised in water combat as well. 2.3.6 Making use of enemies opening doors After an enemy player goes through his team's doors, the doors are momentarily left open. This also happens if you kill an enemy in any doors -- their corpse will hold the door open. This lets you walk through them. You can often get to enemy shops or flagrooms using this in a CTF game. 2.3.7 Small shield glide A shield slide can be performed even on a single block. This can be very helpful in CTF to get some extra speed for crossing larger gaps. 2.3.8 Slash escape Slashing can sometimes be used as an escape mechanism due to the small speed boost it gives. This is usually done when you start charging a slash but notice that the enemy is more likely to hit you due to them starting charging a slash earlier as well as being too close to you -- you avoid getting hit by slash escaping. In the gif below, the red knight would've died if they hadn't slash escaped (slashes have a short duration after releasing and move with the knight, so the blue knight's slash would've likely hit them) In the gif below, I (red knight) slash escape after realising the enemy has started charging a slash earlier than me. 2.3.9 Tower wall jump This is a good way to get some extra horizontal distance when jumping off a tower. To do it, slightly drop off the tower and push off while shield gliding. 2.3.10 Notch climbing If there are small holes in a wall like in the gif below, you can use them to reset your walljump and climb higher. Gaps in walls like that are often accidentally made by bombs. You could actually climb such a wall infinitely, as long as you made sure to reset the wallclimb at every gap. 2.3.11 Bounce off water Shield sliding onto water will allow you to do a little bounce before you sink. This can be useful for quickly moving over water. 2.3.12 Bomb jumps Mentioned in Knight I: The basics, a bomb jump is when knights use bombs to send themselves flying into the air. The simplest bomb jump is a single bomb jump. To perform a single bomb jump, light the bomb, drop it on the ground and as it is about to explode, jump into the air and shield towards the bomb. Timing is crucial to performing bomb jumps. If you time it so you jump and shield at the last possible moment you will go much further (sometimes almost twice as far). You can also perform bomb jumps mid air: Bomb jumps are good for getting around obstacles in CTF, so you should become very comfortable with them. You should always look for situations to utilise them to your advantage. You can also do multi bomb jumps -- read more about them in Playing CTF section. 2.4 More on combat and using your sword The three most important things at this level are: 2.4.1 Slashing fast As mentioned in chapter 1, this is very important. You should be able to do slashes as soon as it's possible (after half a second -- watch your cursor for timings). The same applies to double slashes (38 ticks, that is 1.25 seconds). 2.4.2 Jab after successful slashes This can seem like a basic thing, but it is very rarely used by majority of players, especially on CTF. You can jab right after successfully slashing someone -- the slashed person is stunned for a short while (2/3s of a second) which allows you to make an additional jab in that time (thus dealing a total of 3 hearts of damage). You should almost always do this, the exception is when you're fighting several enemies at once -- so that you don't accidentally jab someone's shield. In these situations you should generally focus on using slashes. You can do the same after successful double slashes when the enemy was shielding (look: double slash section, a bit below). 2.4.3 Low jumps while slashing This is another very important mechanic that you should get into the habit of using. You should almost always slightly jump while slashing -- doing this allows you to gain additional horizontal momentum, thus cover a larger distance, with the added benefit of making your sword's slash range longer (slash range depends on your velocity). All good players do this instinctively -- just keep practicing doing it until it happens naturally. Keep in mind that your jumps should be small. A very common mistake people make is that they jump too far -- jumping too high while slashing makes your slash range worse than if you would actually not jump at all (slashing below you when you're going up has a very small range), making it easier for enemies to slash you from below. Additionally, there are a few more things you should be aware of, such as: 2.4.4 Using double slashes Another common mistake is just constantly single slashing a shielding enemy. Some people use double slashes too rarely. Double slashes are a very good counter against defensive playstyles. Additionally, you can always land a jab after connecting with a double slash. Double slashes are also very good to use after doing a successful slash+jab or a double slash on shield+jab combo. Once you successfully damage the enemy with that combo, your enemy is likely to put his shield up and start retreating. You can then follow him and double slash for an easy kill. All of that happens in the gif below. Keep in mind that better players are likely to jab to break your charging animation -- you can just counterjab in this case and kill them (more about jab trading and counterjabs in the next chapter). 2.4.5 Attacking an enemy who is stunned from jabbing your shield If an enemy makes the mistake of jabbing your shield, you can pretty much always follow up with some damage. You should get into the habit of doing this. There are 3 ways dealing damage to him. If someone jabs a shield, he's stunned for 2/3s of a second - that is plenty of time to deal your damage. Slashing -- This option is the best and should be utilised the most often. As soon as you notice the person has been stunned, start charging a single slash. If you're fast enough, you should always be able to land a slash on the enemy. Remember to follow it up with a jab if your slash connected. Jabbing -- If you don't have the confidence to perform slashes quickly, you can use a single jab. Keep in mind the earlier option is superior to this one and you should eventually learn to utilise it. Double jabbing -- You can land two jabs on an enemy stunned by shield jabbing. This usually happens when you do a jab and then realise there's enough time for a 2nd jab. Keep in mind that it's usually much better to slash than double jab, because you do 1 more heart of damage. If you start charging a slash but the enemy manages to get their shield back up before your slash is charged, you can try to charge it to a double slash. Keep in mind that in this case the enemy has more time to react and can counterjab you, so it's good to keep some distance before the double slash is charged. 2.4.6 Counter slashing / slash baiting If you are against an aggressive player, a good way to beat them is to bait them to attack you with their slash or double slash. As they move towards you, you move away from them whilst charging your own slash. After they miss a slash, you move forwards and slash at them. You can do the same with a double slash or jab. It is hard to counter a defensive play style which focuses on counter slashing. Counter slashing is also the best way to fight against several enemies at once -- a typical combo includes; slash, retreat, slash, and so on. In the gif below, we charge a double slash while baiting the enemy to jump at us (notice the slight left/right movement), then attack them after they miss their first slash. In order to not get hit by their slash, we also release the first slash a very short moment before we get close enough to the enemy. 2.4.7 Winning slash fights on L shape In L shaped environmental situations, the knight who moves first (red in the image below) can lose the slash battle –- even if they slashed earlier. This is because the red player has a larger vertical speed but almost no horizontal speed. The knight who moves second (blue) will have a large horizontal speed towards the enemy – and is thus far more likely to connect first and win the fight. This situation often occurs in CTF when there are doors on top of towers. It is worth mentioning that the L-shape situation usually favours the knight coming up from below. This is partly because you can move upwards more quickly than you can move sideways. Most of the knight’s body is shielded by the blocks going up the wall. In this GIF the blue and red knight arrive together at roughly the same time, but the blue knight wins. In summary -- if you're in the situation in the first gif, try to bait the enemy to slash upwards first, and then follow up with your own slash. In the second situation, to the same, but keep in mind that if you two both slash together at the same time, you'll be the one to win. 2.5 Shield bashing and countering it As mentioned earlier, you can quickly shield slide horizontally into someone or shield down while jumping at an enemy to stun them for a short while -- about half a second. Shield bashing is most useful in narrow corridors where it cannot be countered by an overhead jab or slash. 2.5.1 Shield bash + jab Shield bashing is good for interrupting enemy slashes, but the beauty of shield bashes comes from being able to jab someone right after the shield bash connects. It's a very important aspect of knight combat -- being able to shield bash properly and follow up with jabs can make a big difference, especially when fighting against defensive players. There are several ways to counter shield bashes, all of which you should learn. These include overhead slashing, overhead jabbing and crouching (which you'll learn more about in the next chapter.) 2.5.2 Overhead attacks Jumping over the shield sliding enemy whilst charging a slash and then hitting them in their head/back (either with the charged slash or jab) is a consistent way to beat shieldbashers. In some of the situations, the enemy won't even be able to put his shield back up, no matter what -- if you're shield sliding really fast there is a slight delay before putting your shield back up. However, this doesn't happen every time. You can also do an overhead jab if you don't have enough time to charge a slash: Keep in mind that in this variation, if the enemy manages to put his shield back up, you may get stunned due to jabbing his shield. Again, don't be demotivated if it's hard for you to learn shield bashes. Many good knights struggled with this -- it takes them a while before it clicks and shield bashes just feel natural to them. "],["knight-iii-advanced.html", "Chapter 3 Knight III: Advanced 3.1 Crouching 3.2 Some more moves and tricks 3.3 Using bombs 3.4 Combos after landing a successful slash", " Chapter 3 Knight III: Advanced 3.1 Crouching This is another very important (and largely forgotten) feature in KAG. Basically, when you crouch (hold S) and don't move in any direction, enemies do not collide with you. This allows you to do lots of new situational moves. Keep in mind that slashing moves you slightly, even if you stand still -- you have to re-crouch after releasing every slash. 3.1.1 Countering shieldbashes Aside from overhead attacks to counter enemies shield sliding into you, you can decide to crouch instead. The sliding enemy just goes through you and you can surprise them with an attack right after. You can actually crouch while doing any actions -- even shielding or slashing, as long as you don't move. Any time you move, you have to press S again after that to keep crouching. Keep in mind that there are no seperate animations for crouching while slashing or shielding. 3.1.2 Countering stomps Crouches are a very good counter against stomps as well. If you see someone jumping at you from a distance with their shield down, or if it's an archer or a builder, you should always crouch. 3.1.3 Countering crouches with slash + stomp However, if you have height advantage, you can counter a crouching+shielding enemy by slashing them right before landing on them. In this case, the slash will stun them and you'll be able to stomp them. Also see: Slash stomping (easy version) later this chapter. If you're the one without height advantage fighting a knight that slashes a lot, they're likely to do this, so in that case you may want to not crouch. In this gif, the person we're attacking is constantly trying to crouch. 3.1.4 Countering crouches (equal level) If you're on the same ground level as your enemy and you notice that they're crouching (either trying to protect themselves from a shieldbash or trying to bait you into walking into them), you can try to walk into them and quickly attack before they attack you. 3.1.5 Attacking while being 'inside' someone that's shielding If you or your enemy walk into each other due to crouches, you can make use of that and attack them (with a jab or a slash). However, if they're shielding, it requires you to slash or jab in a specific direction. You must attack in the direction they're shielding, or instead their shield will protect them from the attack. For example, in the image below -- we're inside the red enemy knight. Attacking to the left, top left or bottom left will hit the enemy, but attacks in the opposite directions will be shielded by them. This is because the jab's range doesn't start at the edge of the jab, but rather at the handle of the sword. Some gifs demonstrating this: The best way is to attack is to always just aim in the same place the enemy is aiming their shield towards. If you're fighting against a player who knows this technique, you can prevent them from damaging you by rapidly changing your direction of shielding. For example, I didn't manage to do a 2nd jab on the enemy in the gif below due to them moving their shield around rapidly. Sometimes your enemy may be running into you with their shield up -- this usually happens in narrow spaces. A good trick is to slightly move back and crouch, so that the enemy phases through you. As they get inside you, start moving in the direction they're moving and attack them while aiming in the proper direction. If you're countering a shieldbash or a stomp with a crouch, you want to slash down when the enemy phases into you (they're shielding down, so you want to slash in that direction). 3.1.6 Crouches in actual gameplay In the gif below, our enemy is constantly shielding, so we're baiting them to walk into us. If an enemy is on top of you, you can slash them and then stand still while crouching, and then slash (aiming downwards -- slash in the direction the enemy is shielding towards) to damage them when they phase into you. Generally we can crouch after every slash in narrow spaces or when we're at a slight height disadvantage in case the enemy tries to shieldbash or walk into us. In the gif below, first we damage the enemies, and then when they start shielding we bait them to walk into us. After that we just have to slash in the proper direction (direction enemy is shielding towards) while following the enemies. As soon as we notice that the enemy is trying to jump on us with their shield down, we start slashing while crouching and release the slash (aiming downwards) as soon as the enemy lands. If we successfully slash an enemy knight and they get knocked upwards, they will likely try to fall down on us with their shield down. Crouch and slash after they're inside us. In the gif below, we predict that the enemy will try to move away from us so we get there first, crouch and then slash. Again, notice how we're slashing towards left -- as constantly mentioned, you want to slash in the direction the enemy is shielding towards. Some more baiting so that the enemy goes through us. Getting close to the enemy and then crouching. Even though crouching requires you to stand still, sometimes it can be just a very short while -- time your crouches well, try to surprise your enemy. 3.2 Some more moves and tricks 3.2.1 Jab trading (counterjabs) If you get jabbed any time while not stunned from anything, you can always instantly jab right after before the enemy puts their shield up. This is easiest to do if you are charging a slash or a double slash and get jabbed; in that case, just release left mouse button and start holding right mouse button (shielding) -- if your slash was recently interrupted, you'll just release a jab right after that. If you know that the enemy will counterjab you, you can also counterjab the counterjab (red knight in GIF below). 3.2.2 Jabbing to interrupt double slashes If you're in a situation when the enemy is constantly spamming slashes and you must shield yourself, they may eventually decide to charge a doubleslash. This can be countered: if you notice that they're charging for longer than usual -- a double slash instead of just a single slash, you can jab them and interrupt their slash. This can also be countered -- the person charging a double slash can do a counterjab, like mentioned in the section earlier. To avoid this, you can try to always slightly jump away right after interrupting someone with a jab. The enemy will sometimes try to not be close enough for you to jab -- in some situations if you're fast enough and realise they're going to double slash your shield you can quickly run away with a quick shield slide, but if they're fast they can just slash you before you do that. 3.2.3 Prolonged slashes If you know that the enemy knows how to interrupt double slashes with jabs and does it regularly, you can also prevent them from doing it. You can try charging a slash for a little longer than a perfect 16 tick (half a second) slash, but not as long as a double slash -- if you're lucky, the enemy will attempt a jab but you will slash them first (slashes have priority over jabs) and be able to damage them easily. 3.2.4 Bait jab, punishing enemies for missing slashes A bait jab punishes the enemy for missing their attack. As the enemy ends their slash, get close to them and quickly jab them. They won’t have time to shield. It's a good way to play against players who just slashspam -- bait them to jump at you with their slash, dodge it and then quickly jab right after. You can pretty much do this every time your enemy misses a slash but they're still close enough for you to jab. 3.2.5 Overhead jab Mentioned already as a counter when your enemy attempts to shield bash you with a shield slide, but you can do it when the enemy is just walking forward with their shield up as well: Jump over the enemy’s head quickly and jab them before they can react and move their shield. Instead of clicking, you can also hold your mouse button for a short while until you are at the perfect point to release the jab. 3.2.6 Tempo jab Often you will get into the situation where you are shielding and an enemy knight is repeatedly slashing you. Thus the other knight has the tempo advantage. If you try and slash them, then you will die as you will have begun charging your slash after them – so they will always be able to release earlier. One way to escape this situation is with a quick jab – which will interrupt the enemy’s slash. Beware though –- if you have only 1 heart, a good enemy will instantly counterjab you back for the kill. Also, there's a chance that the enemy will shield after slashing - worry not, you will learn what to do in this case in the next chapter. 3.2.7 Fake jab Sometimes, when you and the enemy are shielding each other, you may attempt to do a fake jab to make the enemy think you jabbed their shield, then start shielding right after, like in the gif: If they will jab your shield, you're able to follow up with an attack (preferably a slash + jab). 3.2.8 Slash stomping (easy version) When you have height advantage over a shielding enemy (at least 3 blocks), you can jump down at them with a slash. The slash will pierce their shield and the additional velocity from slashing will let you stomp them for 1 heart of damage. You can jab after every successful slashstomp. If the enemy isn't shielding, you will do 2 hearts from a slash and 1 heart from a stomp. If you jab right after, that's another heart -- 4 hearts of damage in total. 3.2.9 Cancelling and baiting with a double slash This is a very fun trick to do. Basically, the idea is to charge a double slash, but only slash once, then shield. This way, you will get closer to the enemy, which will think you want to double slash them and try to interrupt with a jab, but will jab your shield instead. 3.2.10 Two-angled/360 slash As mentioned at the start of chapter 2, slashes have a duration after releasing -- this means that the arc (angle) of the slash can be moved for a very short while after releasing left mouse button. Here's how it looks with g_debug 2 in Sandbox: This can be used to attack enemies that are near you from both sides. Example on bots in Sandbox: This is generally done in narrow passages or tunnels in CTF, or when you're trying to fight several enemies at once. Gameplay example (accidentally opened the taunt menu twice, don't mind it): Doing a 360 slash made it possible to both kill the red archer on the right, as well as slash the knights on the left. 3.2.11 Chained shieldbashing It is possible to keep someone in a near permanent stunlock by repeatedly shield bashing them. This move is especially useful to counter someone who is holding a bomb, as they won’t be able to throw it while stunned. 3.3 Using bombs Being able to use bombs efficiently is an important part of 1v1s (in most duels and 1v1 tournaments, knights start with a single bomb). You can use them in several ways: 3.3.1 Bomb jump + slashstomp If the enemy has a defensive playstyle, you can bomb jump and then slash stomp them. However, sometimes it's possible to counter this by slashing above at a correct angle with proper timing before the enemy does, although you may still get 1 heart of damage due to getting stomped: Most of the time the bomb jumping person will still be able to slash first -- they can release the slash before you'd be even able to hit them and they'll still hit you due to the falling velocity, so it's generally not worth trying to slash somebody doing a bomb jump + slash stomp. 3.3.2 Using them after stunning someone Light a bomb and time its explosion with stunning an enemy, either by shield stunning them or slashing them. Keep in mind that in the 2nd variation you may also get damaged because of not being able to shield the bomb (3 hearts if it explodes close to you or 1.5 if a bit further). You can also attempt to slash the enemy right before their own bomb is about to explode. If they throw it right before that, you can catch the bomb and throw it back (do this only if you have more health than the enemy though) 3.3.3 Combat bomb Throw your bomb right so it surprises the enemy and explodes next to them, dealing 3 hearts of damage. Usually the best way to catch an enemy off guard is to aim it just behind their character or at their head. 3.3.4 Bomb and jab/slash combo Instead of stunning the person with a shieldbash or a slash before damaging them with a bomb, here we're doing the opposite. The idea is to light a bomb and throw it behind the enemy (don't do it too early -- you don't want them to throw it back). If it successfully explodes and deals 3 hearts of damage, it will stun the enemy for a short while, allowing you to do another jab and kill them. If the enemy is far away, you can also do it with a slash (to have bigger range) 3.3.5 Water buoyancy for bombs Bombs in water will rise very quickly upwards. This can be used to surprise an enemy. 3.3.6 Catching and throwing back enemy bombs As mentioned in the first chapter, you can catch and throw back enemy bombs. The best way to do this is to catch with C and throw with Space. This is because the Space key cannot catch, only throw -- so it prevents you catching the bomb, throwing it, and catching it again -- which might happen if you just spam C. Be careful doing this -- if the enemy throws their bomb very late, you will just blow yourself up. Water bombs can also be caught, but you have to be careful, since water bombs will explode on impact. You must dodge the bomb, or catch it before it touches anything else. It’s best to do this when the bomb gets thrown above your head, as in the example below. 3.4 Combos after landing a successful slash If you're good and fast enough, just by landing one successful slash (or just doing a doubleslash) you can finish the enemy in most of situations. 3.4.1 Slash + jab + shieldbash + jab Successful slash / double slash on shield Jab Shield bash the enemy to stun them Jab again 3.4.2 Slash + jab + overhead jab A successful slash / double slash on shield + jab combined with an overhead jab. The enemy will still be ‘in shock’ from the slash + jab and usually won’t be fast enough to shield the final jab (he's likely to shield horizontally instead of vertically). However, this can still be shielded if you have fast enough reflexes. Pay attention to what the enemy is going to do after doing a slash + jab combo on you. 3.4.3 Slash + jab + double slash on shield (optionally counterjab) As mentioned in the earlier chapter, once you successfully damage the enemy with that a slash+jab, your enemy is likely to put his shield up and start retreating. You can then follow him and double slash for an easy kill. Generally this is the safest thing to do after doing a slash + jab combo. Even if the enemy will interrupt the double slash and jab you, as mentioned earlier you can counterjab instantly and take their last heart away. "],["knight-iv-expert.html", "Chapter 4 Knight IV: Expert 4.1 More advanced moves and tricks 4.2 Using food items in between double slashes 4.3 Some trivia 4.4 Becoming the best", " Chapter 4 Knight IV: Expert 4.1 More advanced moves and tricks You'll learn about the final tricks which you should learn now, requiring very good timing and being familiar with how the game works in general. 4.1.1 Aggressive jabs One aggressive and extremely fun move is a jab charge -- a quick shield slide to gain speed followed by a jab. This is an effective way to interrupt someone who is charging a slash -- but for it to succeed it must be done with extreme speed and good timing. Keep in mind that sometimes you may want to press left mouse button before you even get near the enemy (jabs aren't instant because you always have slight delay on online servers, and they also have a short duration after release). This also applies to the rest of this section. You can actually try to interrupt every slash with a jab as soon as you're close enough to the enemy -- but keep in mind this requires a lot of focus and very good reflexes. You have only half a second before the enemy is able to release their slash, so be careful. This is something that only the best knights do, but it's very satisfying to constantly interrupt slashes with jabs. If you feel comfortable with doing this and have good reflexes, you can pretty much just constantly stay close to the enemy and interrupt every of their slashes with a jab. Surprise jab right after being unstunned from jabbing enemy shield (notice how I released the jab slightly before I got close enough to the enemy) Another surprise jab on enemy that starts charging a slash after shieldbashing me: Some more jabbing in the gif below. First, me and the enemy start charging a slash around the same time, but I release it as a jab instead of continuing to charge it in case the enemy started charging first. After that, I shieldbash the enemy (which couldn't be crouching because they're moving around) and follow up with a jab. The enemy stays still in place after that happens, so they're likely to be crouching -- I go in and jab in the proper direction. The enemy attempted to jab first but failed. 4.1.2 Instajabs This is a very important move in high end duels, similar to tempo jabs from the previous chapter. It allows you to damage knights that slash your shield, even if they shield right after. Basically -- there's a small delay between slashing and putting your shield back up. If you put your shield up right after slashing, the animation may show, but the shield won't actually be there. During that small delay, and right after your stun from being slashed in the shield is finished, you can jab the enemy. It requires good timing and quite a bit of training. In most cases you want to click left mouse button while you're still stunned on your screen. In the gif below, the red knight is a bot that starts shielding right after finishing a slash. Gifs of instajabs in actual gameplay: Finishing a low-health enemy with an instajab: If you know that the enemy knows how to instajab, you should try to jump back slightly every time after slashing them on their shield. 4.1.3 Instaslashes The idea is that if someone slashes your shield, you can start holding left mouse button as soon as you get stunned, and release it when 75% of the cursor charges (first yellow dot on the cursor charging). Even though you see only 75% of the cursor, you will do a slash both on your screen and the enemy's screen. Any time you do a quick instaslash (75% of cursor), you'll be able to release it faster than the enemy will be able to, even if they're slashspamming. This is due to slashes having a duration after releasing -- you can't instantly start charging another slash after releasing one. Instaslashes make use of that -- they're a perfect counter against slashspamming enemies. You can actually do it from other stuns as well, such as being stunned from fall damage -- start slashing as soon as you get stunned. Instaslashes are actually a very viable trick and not just a niche trick -- if somebody will start charging a slash right after releasing their first one on your shield, you will always be able to slash them. As you can see in the gif below, you can of course do a jab after a successful instaslash -- they're pretty much the same as normal slashes. 90% of the cursor (final yellow dot before full cursor charge) obviously also works, but if the enemy is able to slash fast you may sometimes get slashed first. Try to do instaslashes as fast as possible. Knights can sometimes try to shieldbash after slashing your shield. We can combine crouching with an instaslash to hit them. Instaslashes can be also done from the stun on an unshielded slash and the slight stun from a jab interrupt -- although on 90% of cursor (final yellow dot before full cursor) 4.1.4 Jabbing after slashing shield If you know that the enemy regularly instajabs or instaslashes, you can try to jab right after slashing at their shield. This will prevent them from doing both (although they're still able to counterjab it). Try to not do this too often though -- if the enemy won't be doing an instajab or an instaslash, you will just jab the shield and get stunned. 4.1.5 Jab after being slashed+jabbed You can jab right after being slashed + jabbed if you do it fast enough (I usually just mash the left mouse button when I'm waiting to get unstunned): Even if the enemy shields right after, you will still be able to damage them with a jab (similar to how instajabs work). If you know that the enemy does this consistently, you can counter it in a few ways: counterjab the jab, killing the enemy (if they didn't heal): jump away right after doing the slash + jab combo (this can be hard to do consistently and may not be successful sometimes): not do a jab after a slash (do this if you have 1 heart -- you have time to shield right after and not get jabbed) 4.1.6 Slash stomping (hard) Start charging a slash, jump from the highest point of the enemy that is shielding up (as mentioned earlier, the players' model is a circle) and try to land on a lower point, slightly to the side. This way the slash pierces their shield, and the additional velocity allows you to do a 1 heart stomp. It works the same as a normal slash stomp, so you can jab the enemy after successfully doing this. 4.1.7 Blitz crouch This is a more advanced way to get 'inside' the enemy so you can attack him. To do it, do a shield slide stun which will slightly pop the enemy up in the air. As they fall you move slightly under them and crouch so that they fall into you (both of your hitboxes are overlapping). Works the best when the enemy is next to a wall. At this point, you can phase through the enemy and attack them. 4.1.8 Glue after crouch When you and the enemy keep walking into each other, you can move back slightly, crouch and wait for him to get inside you, then stop the crouching and start walking forward. In some cases you may glue yourself to the enemy (you will be moving the enemy towards where you're walking while still being inside them) -- you should use this to your advantage and slash your enemy when he's confused and doesn't know what direction to shield. On your enemy's screen, you aren't inside them -- you're in front of them. Enemy's POV: Your POV: Example in actual gameplay: If this happens to you after walking into somebody's crouch (although on your screen you may not see yourself walking into a crouching enemy, which is why this happens), you should jab/slash in the opposite direction than you actually see the enemy (if you're walking left with somebody glued to you but them being in front of you from your right side, you should attack while aiming left rather than right). Better yet, you can also do 360 angle attacks (mentioned in chapter earlier, this is when you quickly move your mouse from left to right after releasing an attack -- attacks have a duration so the arc of the attack will be a full 360 angle arc) Another example, although it's a bit harder to notice it here -- this time we're the one being pushed by the enemy: We can tell this is happening to us due to the specific movement of our character and being pushed by the enemy. As you can see, in the above gif I slash right while the enemy is pushing me from the left -- what is actually happening here is that the enemy is inside me and moving their shield around, even though on my screen he appears to my left. This is why I slash right (remember the direction of attack while inside somebody/crouching). You can also notice that I quickly move the cursor to the left after releasing the slash -- to make sure that the enemy gets hit I do a 360/two-angled slash. 4.2 Using food items in between double slashes You can use food items between double slashes from the enemy -- however, you can only do so by opening the inventory with F and hovering over the item, then closing it with F rather than by pressing V (You're able to open and close inventory while stunned, but not use the heal key). It works the same while being stunned from water. Keep in mind that clicking the food item in inventory won't work -- you can't click inventory buttons while stunned -- you have to close the inventory with your mouse button on the item. 4.3 Some trivia Moves that aren't really used, but are in theory possible. 4.3.1 Shield bash + double jab Rather hard move to do, requires good timing and familiarity with shield bashes. Basically, shieldbash someone and then very quickly double jab. Nobody in the game is able to do this consistently as of June 2020, so it's probably more trivia rather than an actual trick. 4.3.2 Shield bash + slash This one is also more trivia than an actual trick, similarly to shield bash + double jab -- it's very hard to do this consistently. Basically, you need to do the fastest slash possible right after stunning the enemy. You basically need to start charging the slash before you know the enemy is even stunned, which is why it's so hard. 4.3.3 Shieldslide crouch Works best on a flat terrain. Basically, do a quick shieldslide, but stop when you're getting closer to the enemy and start holding S. You will still have the momentum from the shield slide and will get inside the enemy. If done with certain timing, it can glue the enemy with you as shown above. Hard to do consistently, so it's again more trivia than an actually useful trick. 4.4 Becoming the best At this point, you know pretty much all the moves. If you can do all of them, all there's left for you to do is just mastering everything. Keep optimising your playstyle. Of course, you won't ever stop doing mistakes completely, but now you just need to focus on doing them less and less. Train your timing and muscle memory to be even better. We recommend getting into competitive CTF if you didn't yet. In our opinion, competitive CTF (Captains, clanwars and so on -- ask around on the official discord, discord.gg/kag) is much more fun than just plain 1v1s and playing TDMs. You also learn how to teamwork much better there, and in general it's a lot more satisfying to play. "],["playing-ctf.html", "Chapter 5 Playing CTF 5.1 Dropping resupplies (dropping mats) 5.2 Buying items 5.3 Teamwork 5.4 On the defense 5.5 On the offense 5.6 Random tricks", " Chapter 5 Playing CTF 5.1 Dropping resupplies (dropping mats) Every time you respawn, you should change on your tent/ballista to builder and back to knight. This way you drop 100 wood and 30 stone (resupplies) and your builders will love you. It may not seem like a lot, but it really helps your builders. 5.2 Buying items There is a lot of items to buy in CTF. The more people you kill, the more coins you gain. There's no much point in hoarding all the coins -- you lose some if you die. 5.2.1 Bombs Most knights decide to buy bombs (knight shop, 25 coins). They're good for killing enemy builders and archers, especially when they try to escape from you. Using them to bomb jump to the enemy base also is a very good strategy. You can also use them in this way -- if only one block thick wall (not doors) seperates you from the enemy builder, you can kill the enemy through the block: Good for killing builders ratting in your tower. If you're protecting a builder in a situation like this, you should shield up - this way the bomb doesn't kill them: 5.2.2 Burgers Burgers are also a decent item (quarters, also known as food shop, 20 coins). They heal you to full health. You can eat them quickly by pressing V. It's useful when you're fighting and don't have much health -- just eat a burger. Using them greatly improves your survivability. 5.2.3 Water bombs They stun the enemy (knight shop, 30 coins). Good for stunning enemies when you're fighting several at once, or stunning archers/builders. Just stun anyone for easily kills. Countered if enemy has a sponge in inventory (as mentioned in the first chapter) 5.2.4 Sponges If you have one in inventory (builder shop, 15 coins), you are stunned for shorter time when hit by a water bomb or water arrow. Sponges absorb up to 2 stuns before being destroyed. Good to buy if you know the enemy team has lots of archers spamming water. 5.2.5 Mines Mines are good for securing important places in your base (knight shop, 60 coins), especially when your team is on the defense. Place at least 1 in flagroom (if enemies get in there, they will be killed by the mine) Place one in tunnels as well -- ratting enemies in most cases don't notice them and die. Placing them next to enemy doors is good as well 5.2.6 Kegs Very good explosive (knight shop, 120 coins). Good for destroying enemy structures. Don't fight enemies while holding it -- losing a keg is bad for your team. Getting yourself launched from a catapult with a keg is a good tactic as well. Kegs, aside from exploding after 6 seconds, explode on impact if they're lit and have enough velocity. Try to not stockpile a lot of kegs in one spot -- kegs can chain explode, so if an enemy gets there somehow, they'll be able to use up all of the kegs. Don't put kegs in your tower either. 5.2.7 Ballista Good siege vehicle (siege shop, 200 coins), can be bought if you've got a lot of money. It lets people respawn on it, so I recommend putting it on top of your tower. 5.2.8 Catapult Another good siege vehicle (siege shop, 80 coins) -- lets you shoot people with it. Place on top of your tower. 5.2.9 Arrows for your archers If you know that you have any good archers in team, you can buy them various arrows, such as fire arrows (especially if enemies got any big wooden structures), water arrows (for stunning enemies) or bomb arrows (for destroying enemy siege vehicles or structures). 5.3 Teamwork Aside from dropping mats, there's some other stuff you should do. 5.3.1 Protect your builders Protect your builders that are trying to push the enemies and attack their base. Stay with them, kill enemies that try to attack them. However, if the builder is trying to rat into the enemy base and places doors like in the gif below, leaving him to fight knights isn't a good idea. In the gif, the knight opened the doors, trying to fight enemies, but died in the process. This causes the death of a builder in 99% situations. If the knight didn't try to attack and didn't die, he could've protected the builder from the builders with drills later on. 5.3.2 Catch bombs Builders and archers have no way to protect themselves from bombs. Catch enemy bombs and throw them back quickly to save them from certain death. 5.3.3 Pick up materials Pick up materials laying on the ground (order of importance: gold &gt; stone &gt; wood) and deliver them to a safe spot or to the closest builder. Do this especially after killing enemy builders. 5.4 On the defense While you're defending yourself from enemies pushing your tower, you should keep some stuff in mind. Some of these apply to other situations as well. 5.4.1 Focus on the builder Kill the builder at all costs. They're the most dangerous -- without them, it's much harder for enemy knights to get inside your base. 5.4.2 Mass-keg You can keg the enemies if there are many of them. However, keep in mind that the enemies could catch it and use it against your tower -- so sometimes (if you see a good player that could catch, for example) it's good to kill yourself with the keg. 5.4.3 Catch enemy kegs If you're quick enough, you can catch enemy kegs by jumping and spamming C when the keg is about to hit the ground. Mostly applies to being on the offense - the enemy team may try to mass-keg you. 5.4.4 Slash ballista bomb bolts You can slash ballista bomb bolts with good timing. Greatly helps if you're under heavy siege. 5.4.5 Shield enemy bomb arrows You should shield enemy bomb arrows - especially if they're aimed at weak points in your tower or the flagroom 5.5 On the offense 5.5.1 Multi bomb jumps Aside from 1-bomb bomb jumps, you may sometimes want to use multi bomb jumps to get to the enemy base: 2 bombs (1st bomb on ground, 2nd in hand): 3 bombs: Place 1st bomb on ground Light and put 2nd bomb in inventory Light 3rd bomb and replace it with the one in your inventory 5.5.2 Enemy tunnels When you get to the enemy tunnel, constantly double slash it. This way, if any enemies go through it, you kill them easily (they're stunned from tunnel travel). In some cases, if someone travels and you don't have a double slash charged, you can use a single slash If you're certain that they don't have a sawtrap on their other tunnels, you can also try using them to get to their base. 5.5.3 Enemy siege vehicles Generally, if it's a catapult, you should just destroy it (easy money), unless it still has wheels attached and you can use it to hurt the enemies. If you have enough time, capture it. As for ballistas, depends on the situation. Generally, if you're safe on the enemy ballista, and no enemies are coming, capture it. If there are lots of enemies trying to get it back -- swap to builder on it and block enemies from coming. If you can't secure the ballista, destroy it as a builder (5 coins per pickaxe hit as well). 5.5.4 Keg jump Bomb jumping with a keg in your hand is a decent strategy which allows you to hurt the enemy structures significantly. 5.6 Random tricks 5.6.1 Sawjump Bombs explode when they get destroyed. If bombs explode at the same moment, you can make a pretty awesome bombjump. Saws are used for this. Works like this: You can also do it with holding a keg in hand to get to the enemy base. Another variation includes holding a crate with a builder in it. 5.6.2 Keg + waterbomb (Hadouken kegs) This also applies to TDM. If you explode a water bomb on a keg (with enough momentum) the keg will quickly go forward and explode on impact. Can be done mid-air as well if done quickly enough. Can be used to hurt enemy structures -- enemies most likely won't catch the keg. 5.6.3 Mine + bomb Mines need to stay still to be able to deploy -- so you can't deploy them in mid air. However, you can deploy one on top of your enemy tower, and then push it forward with a bomb or a waterbomb. 5.6.4 Hitting enemies at specific door angles In situations like in the gif below, you're not able to slash the builder due to the door being there. Doors absorb damage from slashes. To avoid this, you want to do a two-angled slash so that the arc of the slash doesn't hit the door -- slash away and then move your cursor from the below to the right. This way you'll be able to damage the builder without hitting the door. Some more gifs demonstrating this with g_debug 1 turned on to show the slash arc: Opposite of the gif above (switched places): Opening a single door and slashing downwards to not hit the top door: Skipping door: Slashing through a gap when there's a door -- slight jump so that your slash doesn't hit the door and is able to hit the enemy: Slashing through a gap when there's a door downwards: Slashing through a gap when there's a door upwards (note that you need some space): 5.6.5 Slashing through one block gaps You can slash through one block gaps. In case the gap is under you, you want to slash slightly to the side. This is a bit confusing, but it's due to how slash arcs work. You have more range when slashing sideways because of where the slash hitbox is attached to. 5.6.6 Using 360 slashes to damage multiple doors Due to the way slashes work against doors and slash arcs, if you keep slashing two doors without moving your cursor, you will only damage one of them. However, if you move your cursor around your character (360 degree slashes) you will be able to damage both doors. "],["playing-with-lags.html", "Chapter 6 Playing with lags 6.1 Practice 6.2 How to play 6.3 Bomb jumping with lags", " Chapter 6 Playing with lags 6.1 Practice If you want to learn how to play with lag, and you mostly play with good ping, it's basically like relearning KAG. Most of being able to play with lag is just practice and training -- there's not much to be said in this chapter, however there are some things we'd like to say. But remember -- want to dominate on 166 ping, play a lot on 166 ping. Focus on getting used to your positioning. Timing and whatnot is important of course, but getting used to where you really are is fundamental. 6.2 How to play With lag, you do things earlier than they actually happen. This includes stuff like slashing, shielding and moving. Most of your playstyle on lags should consist of just slashes, preferably single slashes. They're the easiest to learn on ping (their different range and timing) if you just use them a lot, and if you keep baiting enemies then you can even kill some rather good US players without dying much. Of course, you should still jab after slashes. We actually don't know if most moves are possible with lags, but they are for sure MUCH, MUCH harder to do. For example, shieldbashing feels odd with lag, at least when you're on top of the enemy, so it is also a thing you should be careful with doing. Instajabs are still possible with lag (tested on 166 ping), however you really need to train it a lot to be able to use it consistently -- avoid doing it in real matches until you train it. You could try setting up a server which you have 166 ping on and train the instajabs on there with the help of a friend. 6.3 Bomb jumping with lags This one is at least much easier with ping. You don't need to be able to do double bomb jumps or triple bomb jumps. Just put 4 lit bombs on ground and you will gain lots more velocity than if you had 0 ping.
