## The knight class

There are three classes in KAG; the archer, the builder and the knight. The knight is arguably the strongest class of the game. A good team in Capture The Flag (CTF) or Take The Halls (TTH) should be mostly composed of knights protecting the builders and archers. In Team Deathmatch (TDM) the knight is often the most played class.

As a knight in CTF and TTH, your role is to help the team advance forward and capture the enemy flag or hall. Before you start to learn more about the game modes and how to play in them, letâ€™s talk about combat mechanics first.

## Mechanics

As a knight, you can utilise your sword and shield to do the following things:

### Jab

The simplest attack. It does 1 heart of damage.

### Slash

A charged attack (it takes half a second to charge one -- just focus on the cursor charging). A slash does 2 hearts of damage and stuns the enemy for a short time. If the enemy is shielding, you will break their shield, stunning them for a short time but the enemy will not get damaged.

*Being able to do a slash as fast as possible is very important -- you should be able to do them as soon as the cursor charges fully.*

<video style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto;" src="webm/01-basics/3.webm" controls loop="loop" preload></video><br>

### Double slash

A double slash takes 1.25 seconds to fully charge. Again, watch the cursor for timings. A double slash does 4 hearts of damage in total (if unshielded). If the enemy is shielding, the first slash breaks the shield, the second slash deals 2 hearts of damage.

<video style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto;" src="webm/01-basics/5.webm" controls loop="loop" preload></video><br>

For now you should keep in mind that if you jab a shield, you will get stunned for a short while. Try avoiding jabbing a shield, because you can get counter jabbed during the stun, or in some cases even slashed:

### Shield slide

Holding W and pointing your shield down while moving horizontally will allow you to slide.

<video style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto;" src="webm/01-basics/8.webm" controls loop="loop" preload></video><br>

### Shield bash

Also known as a shield stun. If you quickly shield slide into someone, they can get stunned for a short time (and sometimes knocked back):

### Shield glide

You can use your shield as a parachute:

### Stomping

Not specifically a knight-only move, but you can stomp the enemy if you fall onto them with enough momentum.

<video style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto;" src="webm/01-basics/13.webm" controls loop="loop" preload></video><br>

---

You can do much more with these moves -- you can perform combos, such as slashing someone and then quickly jabbing them after; but you'll learn about that later on. For now, it's important to know the theory on how knight combat works. The one thing you should remember is to mostly use slashes for now -- the most common mistake a newbie can do is to jab spam, which is easily countered by shielding, and can quickly get you killed.

## Items

There are various knight-specific items that you can utilise, such as bombs or waterbombs. These can be bought at the knight workshop in CTF (25 coins for a bomb, 30 coins for a waterbomb), trader shops in TDM (20 coins for a bomb, 40 coins for a waterbomb) or generated by factories in TTH.

### Bombs

Bombs are activated by pressing space bar. It takes 4 seconds for a bomb to 'cook' before it explodes. You can throw bombs at enemies to damage them (the damage taken depends on how close the bomb lands -- 3 hearts or 1,5 hearts), or use it to do a bomb jump.

<video style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto;" src="webm/01-basics/15.webm" controls loop="loop" preload></video><br>

Keep in mind that if you throw the bomb too early the enemies can pick it up and throw it back.

### Waterbombs

Waterbombs explode on impact and stun for a short duration. If shielded, they stun for a slightly shorter time. You can also put a sponge in your inventory (bought at TDM trader shop or CTF builder shop) that will reduce the stun duration. If you successfully stun someone with a water bomb, you can follow up with a counter attack, such as a double slash to kill.

### Mines

Mines can be bought for 60 coins in a knight shop and can be activated by all classes. Mines activate after being thrown onto the ground for some time. Mines instantly kill enemies and can't be shielded, so you should watch out for enemy mines! **This is especially important when playing CTF and pushing with your team in a closed space -- let the builders destroy the mines, don't walk into them -- if you walk into a mine and your teammates are also near, they will be killed as well**

### Kegs

Kegs (costs 120 coins in knight shop) are powerful and unshieldable explosive items with a 6 second fuse. You should avoid fighting enemies while holding a keg (you can't put it in your inventory) because they may steal it and hurt your team (one of the most common mistakes that can be made). Generally, you should activate kegs in the middle of the enemy base or next to the enemy flag room.

## Mobility

One of the most important things to learn when you're starting to play KAG is how to navigate the terrain properly. If you don't feel comforatble with your character and its movement, you will have trouble slashing your enemies from a distance or even avoiding enemy attacks. You have to be able to move around obstacles freely, consistently use wall jumps, use your slash to gain additional momentum or jump forward while slashing to quickly move through terrain.

<video style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto;" src="webm/01-basics/25.webm" controls loop="loop" preload></video>

<video style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto;" src="webm/01-basics/27.webm" controls loop="loop" preload></video>

There's not much to explain regarding basic movement -- it will take practice. If you want to get better with movement faster, you can try experimenting with it in solo gamemodes (Save the Princess, Challenges modes etc.) You will learn more about mobility tricks during the next chapter.

## Learning

Every time you die to someone, ask yourself a question -- why did I die? Could I have done something to avoid death? Did I mess up timing or get baited by the enemy? Always try to learn from your mistakes and learn minimize them as much as possible. Look at what you're doing wrong (jabbing enemy's shield, bad slash timing and so on) and try to optimize your playstyle.

<video style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto;" src="webm/01-basics/29.webm" controls loop="loop" preload></video><br>

<video style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto;" src="webm/01-basics/30.webm" controls loop="loop" preload></video>

Remember to slash often -- if you constantly slash, the enemies will be afraid to get closer to you. Make use of double slashes as well -- the first slash break through the shield and the second one deals 2 hearts of damage, as mentioned earlier.

<video style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto;" src="webm/01-basics/31.webm" controls loop="loop" preload></video><br>

Don't get demotivated if you're not as good as you want to be -- as we said earlier, at this level you just need to practice a lot. Skill will come with time. Most of the players get stuck at what this guide considers the *average* level. The next chapters should help you get past that point.
