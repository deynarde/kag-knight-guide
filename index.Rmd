# Introduction {-}

We have read many tutorials concerning knight gameplay, both on the THD Forums and Steam Community Hub, and most of them were either shallow or outdated. Considering we've got a lot of new players recently, we have decided to write a new player friendly guide for the knight class.

We hope this guide will help people who are trying to get better at knight. We are going to cover everything including: improving your skill to various levels, how to play CTF, how to deal with high ping or bugs, every knight trick/move you can do in this game and much more. It may seem like a lot, but knight combat is very extensive and if you want to get better this guide will certainly help you.
